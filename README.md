## 📊 Project Overview
Machine Learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic disaster. This is a classic binary classification problem using passenger data like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

**Goal**: Build a model to predict whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0) with the highest possible accuracy.
